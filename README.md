==========

I am learning Flask by creating a web app for my [follow](https://github.com/einashaddad/follow) project. 

Follow is a python program that scrapes the Hacker School website for students' GitHub handles and then makes API calls to follow all current batch students on GitHub.

####To run on your localhost:

    python web_button.py
    
####To install all python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt --no-index

####Here's what it looks like:

The sign in page:

Invalid GH username/password:

Result of following all the things:
